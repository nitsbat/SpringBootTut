Spring boot is a way in a which we can bootstrap or start a enterprise level project. It is used to make production grade spring applications 
that we can run. We can build or create an api using this. e.g we have made a course management api in example.


Problems with spring 

1) Huge framework
2) Lot of setup and configuration steps.
3) Lot of deploy steps.

So its Spring boot is a bootstrap to our application. Whenever we make an application in spring boot, it creates an standalone project.
Don't nned to deploy , the server will run on its own. Its totally a production ready code.


***********************************************************************************

When we create a spring boot project using maven we generally give the parent pom.
It is because the spring developers had already made a starter pack which contains pre properties and configurations to just start
building your application, hence we give the pre define pom as the parent in our pom.
So the parent pom will be like 
<parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.4</version>
    </parent>
	
	and our pom will be the child pom of this.
